Arrow 0.10.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-16

Removes the xElemIs*, xElemNot* and xReject* family of functions,
replacing them with the more generix xElemIs and xElemNot.

Enhancements:

* Added xElemIs and xElemNot. These functions test each element of a
collection for equality to a value.

* Renamed xIsNot to xNot, for consistency with the other predicate names
in Arrow.

* Removed xElemIsFalse, xElemIsNa, xElemIsTrue, xElemNotFalse, xElemNotNa,
xElemNotTrue, xElemIsNull, xElemIsNan, xElemNotNan, xElemNotNull,
xRejectNa, xRejectNan, xRejectNull, xRejectEmpty. The rational for this
is that arrow emphasises compositionality, and each case these functions solve can easily be done with other functions. This reduces the number
of tests and documentation to be maintained significantly.

Bug-Fixes:

* xByColkeys and xByRowkeys now return character vectors.

Documentation:

* Added large example to xFix.

* Clarified/corrected return values of xWrite* family of functions.

* Corrected type signatures of xMinBy and xMayBy.

* Corrected return value of xByColkeys.

* Clarified xFromChars' description.

* Added minor details to xIsMatch.

* Added example to xByCols and xByRows.

* Added example to xNotNa.

* Added example to xNotNan.

* Removed non-parsing example from xUnzipIndices.

* Added example to xUnzipIndices.

* Extended xUnit's example.

Package Internals:

* Removed unevaluated check for arrow objects in one case
of as_typed_vector's if condition.

* Added test to xUnionOf.











Arrow 0.9.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-12

This release adds xIsNot, improves documentation.

Enhancements:

* added xIsNot, a complement to xIs.

* Improved error messages provided when converting vector types;
if an arrow object is supplied (accidentally) this is stated.

* Implemented basic object summarisation for data frames (upon error).

Bug-Fixes:

* xAtCol now attempts to container type-convert its numeric input "num".

Documentation:

* Added details and corner cases to xAtCol.

* Added details to xUnzipIndices.

* Added corner cases section to xAsComplex, xAsCharacter.

* Clarified a corner case in xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf.

Package Internals:

* added fromStream, part of the testing tool in development.
* throw_arrow_error can now be called without a call argument.
* forall will now correctly report errors; previously the argument order was backwards.












Arrow 0.8.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-11

This release drastically improves the appearance of error messages.

Enhancements:

* improved the appearance of error messages; they now take up less space.

* for error-causing lists, two new properties are displayed in the error:
'is nested' and 'all nested'.

Package Internals:

* renamed propeties of summate to use whitespace instead of underscores.

* as_typed_vector and as_atom are now more documented, and slightly more efficient.

* refactored back end to remove older error-message containing like exclaim and lament,
in favour of in-place definitions.

* removed maybe_atomic & newline

* used as_parameters in MakeVariadic, to avoid code duplication.











Arrow 0.7.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-10

A mostly internal release, renamed Any, xNone, to xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf.

Enhancements:

* Renamed xAll, xAny, xNone, to xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf. This complies better
with Arrow's naming conventions.

* Functions that require collections, functions, or collections of functions
will now inform the user if they were (accidentally) given an arrow object.

Documentation:

* Added more accurate desciption to the xAs* family of container converters.

* Escaped most special characters in type signatures; html documentation will now
render correctly in most cases.

* Minor updates to the readme.

Package Internals:

* Deprecated and removed assert, moving over to the more flexible
functions throw_arrow_error and throw_arrow_warning.

* Added extensive tests for xUnzipIndices.

* Added test to ensure xJoin always returns a list.











Arrow 0.6.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-7

Added xNotSubset, renamed xNot and removed xAsClosure.

Enhancements:

* Added xNotSubset, to complement the function xIsSubset.

* Renamed xNot to xNegate, to allow for a complement to be added to xIs.

* Removed xAsClosure; the function had very minimal likely use-cases,
and did not work for every primitive function.

Package Internals:

* Removed a lot of dead code (mostly error message code).

* Added tests to xElemIs_ functions.

* Made stringify_call more robust.

* Commented xList code extensively.












Arrow 0.5.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-4

A feature-rich version; adds three new functions for testing equality
and match/mismatch against a regular expression.

Enhancements:

* Added xIs; a function for testing if values are identical.

* Added xIsMatch; tests if a string matches a regular expression.

* Added xNotMatch; tests if a string doesn't match a regular expression.

Bug-Fixes:

* renamed xAddKeys... to xAddKeys_, to keep in step with other variadic
methods.

Documentation:

* Added example for xIs.

Package Internals:

* Added tests for xIs, xIsMatch, xNotMatch.











Arrow 0.4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-4

This version adds xNone and a logo, and fixes an important bug in error-reporting
functions (no irony whatsoever).

Enhancements:

* Added xNone; the antonym of xAllOf. It completes the set of functions
xAllOf (does every element match a predicate?), xAnyOf (does any element match a predicate?)
and now xNone (does no value match a predicate?).

Bug-Fixes:

* Fixed an issue in reporting of missing arguments (and possibly other exceptions). The
name of the argument for which an error is thrown is now displayed properly.

Documentation:

* Added a prototype logo for Arrow!

* Added details section to xMap, explaining the basic concept of map.

* Added details section to xVersion, explaining the semantic versioning standard.

* Added example for xLastOf.

Package Internals:

* Fixed broken link tags in header of staticdocs head file.

* Added contact page (though jQuery) to staticdocs site.

* dQuote now lazily captures its argument.

* added tests for xNone.










Arrow 0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-3

A bug-fix release.

Enhancements:

* Very slightly improved xProdSetOf's efficiency by changing an inner Map
to lapply.

Bug-Fixes:

* Fixed a bug in as_method, in which variadic methods were not being generated
due to the use of an outdated regular expression to test whether the input function
was variadic.

* Type-errors in functions that take collections (xExplode for example) now report
the user-facing function they were thrown from.

* Fixed corner-case for xOneOf; if given a length one vector it extracts the value
from its collection (if it is a list).

Documentation:

* Added most missing type signatures to function docs.
* Added several missing titles to function docs.

Package Internals:

* as_atom and as_typed_vector now use the parent call
(sys.call(-1)) in error reports.

* Added test to check that every function has a type signature and title.











Arrow 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-2

A minor release, mostly housekeeping and repaying technical debt.

Bug-Fixes:

* the xAsComplex, xAsInteger... family of functions now support conversion
of lists that contain NA values of any mode, at the cost of some performance.

* xLambda now checks that ':' is used as a parametre delimiter;
previously several infix functions could be used.

Documentation:

* type signatures added to several more function's documentation.

Package Internals:

* internal function `MakeVariadic` used to generate variadic forms of
functions, which should help avoid bugs in their definitions.

* eliminated most error-message functions, in favour of in-place
definitions and macros. This removed a lot of unneeded code.

* internal function `unit_to_value` now supports complex values.










Arrow 0.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-4-30

The initial release of Arrow. A highly experimental release, and ideally not
the version the public will see.
